# Joshs-Random-Song-Alarm

Very simple functionality, you point it at a folder and set the alarm time, and it'll play a song at random, and keep playing songs until you turn it off. 

The first project I made that didn't come from a course, the first time I had an idea and set out to figure out how to make it real.

Definitely more sentimental value than real-world.
